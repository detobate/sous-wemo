Sous-WeMo
========

A small script to control a [Belkin WeMo switch](http://www.belkin.com/uk/F7C027-Belkin/p/P-F7C027/) for [sous-vide cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide).

Usage:
------
Install the required python modules:

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:

    usage: souswemo.py [-h] [--list] [--mon] [-s 'Switch Name'] [-t TEMP] [-T TIME] [-f FUDGE]

    A WeMo control for sous-vide cooking

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help      show this help message and exit
      --list          List available WeMo switches
      --mon           Monitor current temperature without controlling a switch
      -s Switch Name  WeMo Switch Name
      -t TEMP         Target Temperature suffixed with either C or F
      -T TIME         Timer in minutes
      -f FUDGE        Fudge factor. Pre-emptively turn switch off/on. Provide
                      value w/ suffix: C or F

Example:

    ./souswemo.py -s 'Slow Cooker' -t 60C -T 120

List Switches:

    ./souswemo.py --list
    Starting WeMo listen server
    Available switch names are:
    ['Big lights', 'Little lights', 'Slow Cooker']

Requirements:
-------------
* Waterproof [DS18B20](https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=DS18B20) One Wire temperature probe. (or other probes supported by the [w1thermsensor](https://github.com/timofurrer/w1thermsensor) Python module)
    Follow [these](http://www.modmypi.com/blog/ds18b20-one-wire-digital-temperature-sensor-and-the-raspberry-pi) instructions if using a RaspberryPi.
* A GPIO Interface, such as on a RaspberryPi or Beaglebone. [VirtGPIO](https://github.com/BLavery/virtual-GPIO) may also work but hasn't been tested.
* Python2.6 and modules listed in [requirements.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/detobate/sous-wemo/master/requirements.txt)


Example:
--------

    ./souswemo.py -s 'Slow Cooker' -t 75C -T 360
    Finding WeMo switches
    Turning Slow Cooker Switch on
    Device on switch Slow Cooker Switch is at target temperature 75C
    Press Enter to start the 360 minute timer
    Current temp: 76.062C @ 01:51 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is False

    Timer started, start time: 01:51 PM
    Current temp: 76.187C @ 01:51 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is False
    Current temp: 76.062C @ 01:52 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is False
    Current temp: 68.812C @ 01:52 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is False
    Turning Slow Cooker Switch on
    ...
    Current temp: 74.875C @ 01:57 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is True
    Current temp: 74.937C @ 01:57 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is True
    Current temp: 75.0C @ 01:58 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is True
    Turning Slow Cooker Switch off
    Current temp: 75.0C @ 01:58 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is False
    Current temp: 75.0C @ 01:59 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is False
    Current temp: 75.062C @ 01:59 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is False
    Current temp: 75.062C @ 02:00 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is False
    ...
    Current temp: 74.687C @ 07:50 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is True
    Current temp: 74.75C @ 07:51 PM - Switch Slow Cooker Switch is True
    Turning Slow Cooker Switch off
    Timer 360 mins reached. Switch Slow Cooker Switch is now off
    Average temperature was 74.8357018545 with a 30 second accuracy

Troubleshooting:
----------------
Q: My switch isn't found but I can see it in the WeMo app.

A: Try increasing the [discovery timer](https://github.com/detobate/sous-wemo/blob/master/souswemo.py#L134)

Q: It can't find my temperature probe.

A: Make sure your probe shows up in: ``/sys/bus/w1/devices/``.  
    If not, check you've added `dtoverlay=w1-gpio` to your `/boot/config.txt` (RaspberryPi)


Extra notes:
------------
- Accuracy value of 30 seconds appears to produce a deviation of approx. Â± 0.7C in my slow cooker set on low.
    15 sec accuracy helps, but fluctuations tend to decrease during longer cooks
    Use -f "Fudge Factor" to help pre-empt the fluctuations.
